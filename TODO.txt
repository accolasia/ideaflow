Bugs in UI caused by API changes that were missed in tests:

1. Events and TimeSegments disappeared from API because events were not being persisted with taskId, and thus not being retrieved.

2. When switching from TimelineSegment to BandTimeline (one segment) several fields disappeared (start/end/duration)

3. UI depends on all ids being populated and consistent between timeline/band and timeline/tree views.

4. UI depends on all ids being unique across timeBands and timeGroups, events must be unique across events

5. TimeSegment ids are expected to have an id matching an event id, or be null (first segment)

1. start ifm-publisher; create ifm and start band; restart ifm-publisher and end band - InvalidTransitionException is thrown
